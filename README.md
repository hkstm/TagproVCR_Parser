# TagproVCR_StatParser
P.o.C. Kera's Tagpro VCR -> Ronding's tagpro.eu
Creates a .json stat file that Ronding's [tagpro.eu](https://tagpro.eu/) accepts based on [a tagpro VCR file](https://keratagpro.github.io/tagpro-vcr/).
It replays the game in realtime (so for a 10 minute game it will take (slightly more than) 10 minutes to run) to Ronding's statcollector and saves the resulting json to the data folder
